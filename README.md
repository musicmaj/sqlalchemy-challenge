# sqlalchemy-challenge
This SQLAlchemy Challenge is in two parts.
Part 1 involved using Jupyter Notebook to make a database connection by creating an engine and using automap_base(). I linked the database and then was able to access the data to do a Precipitation and Station Analysis which utilized queries to access the information necessary to do the analysis on the dates requested and for the individual station requested. Results from certain queries were saved as Pandas DataFrames. Matplotlib was used to plot the Precipitation dataframe and a histogram was used for the temperature dataframe.
Part 2 required that I design a Flask API based on the queries from part 1. Six pages were created with various similar queries to the jupyter notebook, but using Flask, HTML, and JSONify. This part was particularly challenging and I needed additional help from the Xpert, my tutor, Anna Poulakos, and to go over code shared from Alexander Booth from previous classes in order to execute all of the details requested.
